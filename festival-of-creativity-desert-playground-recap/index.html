<p>This past winter 2011 <a href="http://doteki.com/?page_id=96">Tim Gerrits</a> and I were lucky to be invited to work with Boyd Branch, Daniel Roth and Southwest Scrap Exchange on a small arts center grant for <a href="https://www.mesaartscenter.com/spark">Mesa Festival of Creativity 2012</a>. The grant concept was a &quot;Desert Playground&quot; which we ended up interpreting as a series of interactive cactuses utilizing Southwest Scrap Exchange creative reuse.</p>
<hr />
<p>We brainstormed several different cactus concepts (my favorite that didn't make it was a tumbleweed style cactus via a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hslphotosync/6610769033/">hamster ball prototype</a> ) but I mainly worked on a motion sensitive pool noodle agave (above)</p>
<p>The whole project was incredibly price sensitive and for a long time I couldn’t figure out how to afford enough motion sensors to enable interactivity in so many leaves. Tim Gerrits ended up inventing a very clever cheap motion switch based on a spring, copper tube and ball bearing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tumblr_inline_p43wj0lp3u1rp3p4d_540.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>With so much wiring I wanted clean consistent connections so I fabbed a mosfet driver screw shield to break out an Arduino Mega for its large amount GPIO. I brainstormed with Jasper a simple <a href="https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/Agave/blob/master/code/agave_final.ino">fall off algorithm that loaded a random number into an array upon motion, then just slowly shifted the bits off until the cactus eventually settled back to stillness</a>. We also added an attract mode so it would freak out if left alone too long.</p>
<p>The Prickly Pear was the last to come together and became much more art the science.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tumblr_inline_p43w7k9MVb1rp3p4d_540.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>We developed a concept of ‘flowers’ <a href="https://vimeo.com/49778644">that would slowly ‘die out’ when plucked</a>. I wound coils and hid them in the agave paddles and wired them down to the same mosfet power shield we used in the Agave.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tumblr_inline_p43wlxhWDX1rp3p4d_540.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Then I wound another coil around 20oz plastic bottles ‘flowers’. I swapped out caps until I had decent coupling to transfer enough power to light up an led from ~6 inches away.</p>
<p>Grant based art work is incredibly grueling and I gained a lot of appreciation for those hustling a livelihood or donating their time for work on stuff like this. Not to mention being humbled by trying to build something children can’t destroy over even just a three day period.</p>
