You might have used ino and stino for Arduino builds within in sublime, but ino has been very poorly supported for some time now. 

Ive Previously used the recently released Arduino CLI for [automated testing](http://citizengadget.com/post/115195131742/automated-build-testing-for-arduino-libraries) so I decided to hack those features into a proper sublime build system. The result is [arduino-cli, a complete stino replacement.](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/arduino-cli)

You're required to have Arduino installed, and Its only OSX right now, but allows you to build and program your Arduinoâ€™s with just a Ctrl-B.  


Find it in your nearest Package Control today.
