Around October of 2009 HeatSync began planning to build a 3d printer as one of our first community projects. We had just been incorporated and the Rep Rap Mendel had just been released. It was heady times.

It is now a year later we've lost a lot of good men to this project.  This blog is dedicated to those brave souls.
