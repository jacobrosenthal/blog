@intel_jim brought over a new set of 3d prints for our little 'showcase' of 3d printing technologies. These are from the local print house [PADT](http://www.padtinc.com/ "PADT") and show off several prints mixing various rubbers and plastics in various configurations. My understanding is he got these by touring the facility. Is PADT our next HeatSync field trip?

They join our Theo Jansen Walker from the Z-Corp inkjet binder process, the hand from the Solido LOM process, and our Rep Rap parts made on the Dimension Stratasys.
