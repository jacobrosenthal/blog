We're doing a ton of 3d printing at the lab right now with Moheeb's Thingomatic and our Fakerbot. Moreso, Prescott and I are talking about a custom MK7 extruder for the Fakerbot, Moheeb and I are talking about reviving the Mendel with new Prusa parts, and Raymond and Corey are silently slaving away on their custom Ultimaker builds. Stop in!
