Today I developed custom brackets and installed into our Love-able Fakerbot the Gen4 mechanical endstops.

When we ordered our Gen4 electronics from Makerbot they came with 3 endstops, though the cupcake wasn't terribly suited for them out of the box.  I developed brackets to install 2 of the endstops but couldn't find our third endstop.  Since this IS a hackerspace I went ahead and etched a board utilizing our laser cutter and laser transfer technique for the third and installed that as well.

Fakerbot now acts almost entirely like a thing-o-matic by homing it's x,y and z. No more heating plastic or using paper to align the z!
