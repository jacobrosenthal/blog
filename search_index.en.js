The Lead Scout has wifi and talks to the other scouts nearby via mesh networking (non compliant Zigbee sadly). After playing around a bit I came to the conclusion that I liked the hardware. As opposed to the Spark, these are truly Arduinos. In addition to a nice webshell (via bitlash) and set of API's you can write code as you normally would right within in the Arduino IDE. This is in stark contrast to the Spark which emulates Arduino from an as yet unfinished web IDE where libraries are largely not yet ready. It's worth noting that I think the Spark is my long term bet, but in the short term our hackerspace has been lousy with the Spark and nobody's doing anything with them. That said I found the prototyping shield not enough room to play in. I wanted a full development environment so I set out to create one.\nHow to run Pinoccio in Atmel Studio 6.2 (IE for simulating and step by step debugging):\n\nMake sure you have the Arduino files (go with the nightly build Pinoccio recommends) installed at: C:\\Program Files\\Arduino\nand the Pinoccio libraries and hardware installed at:\nC:\\Users\\XXXX\\Documents\\Arduino\nNow for the Atmel Studio setup. The full description for how to do this in general is up at Engblaze, but I've done the hard work and uploaded a completed 6.2 solution to Github.\nUnzip it to C:\\Users\\XXXX\\Documents\\Atmel Studio\nOpen it up and you should be able to simulate and debug your bootstrap code!\nHow to burn an Atmega256rfr2 Xplained Pro or other breakout as a Pinoccio from within Atmel Studio\nAtmel makes a breakout for the Atmega256rfr2 called the Atmega256rfr2 Xplained Pro.  It doesnt have the Fuel Guage, or FTDI chip for serial communication, but its a great breakout with onboard debugger and plenty of room to work.\nFirst, you'll need to set the fuses. Look them up and set them in Atmel Studio.\nOther than that everything is the same as above except I had to make one change to halFuelGauge.cpp because it'll hang trying to talk to our non existent fuel gauge:\nunsigned int HAL_FuelGaugei2cRead16(unsigned char address) {\n\tint data = 0;\n\n\tWire.beginTransmission(MAX17048G_ADDRESS);\n\tWire.write(address);\n\tWire.endTransmission();\n\n\tWire.requestFrom(MAX17048G_ADDRESS, 2);\n\twhile (Wire.available() &lt; 2);\n\tdata = ((int) Wire.read()) &lt;&lt; 8;\n\tdata |= Wire.read();\n\n\treturn data;\n}\n\nNow just burn that image.\nTo actually talk to the board you'll need to add an ftdi friend\nFrom the Pinoccio definitions we know the serial pins are RX to PE1 and TX to PE0 and black to GND.\nNow you can open up your serial port and you'll see the bitlash command prompt just like it was a real Pinoccio!\nNOTE: if you want opening serial to reset the board, you're going to have to add in the reset line. Note, however, you'll need a .1uF capacitor between your RTS on the ftdi friend and the RSTN pin.\nHow to have your Atmega256rfr2 discovered by HQ as a real   ~~boy~~ Pinoccio\nThis is pretty difficult. Before you go any further, know even I haven't successfully done this yet.\nFirst you need to buy and hook up a MAX17048 / MAX17049 fuel gauge breakout. Test without the code from the previous section commented out and make sure it all works, or at least doesnt freeze the sketch trying to find it.\nNext, you need to have the bootloader burned on to your Atmega256rfr2.\nYou can find a hex to burn from Atmel Studio in the Pinoccio Github and again make sure to look up and program the fuses as before.\nOr you can hook up an ISP programmer using the pin definitions as guide and burn it right from Arduino, knowing it'll get all the fuses itself.\nNow that you have a bootloader you can upload the Examples-&gt;Pinoccio-&gt;Bootstrap sketch right from Arduino.\nFinally you'll need to either edit the Pinoccio HQ Chrome Extension with your FTDI's PID and VID set to be Pinoccio (VENDOR_ID 0x1d50, PRODUCT_ID = 0x6051), or burn a new PID and VID to your FTDI with FT_Prog. Since Burning a VID and PID didn't work for me (the drivers still didn't really think it was a Pinoccio) I'd suggest the Chrome Extension route.\nGo to Chrome Extensions, and turn on Developer Mode in the upper right corner. Then find Pinoccio. Disable it and look for its id like njhfipeehmigebbdfbingghcjdfmjeai.\nOn my Mac I found the files at  /Users/XXXXX/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/njhfipeehmigebbdfbingghcjdfmjeai and copied the version named folder out to the Desktop.  Windows folks should find their folder in a more Window-sy location.\nNow edit the manifest.js file to add your FTDI's vendor and product ID like so\n\"usbDevices\": [\n{\n  \"productId\": 24657,\n  \"vendorId\": 7504\n},\n{\n  \"productId\": 24577,\n  \"vendorId\": 1027\n}]\n\nNext, open up the pinoccio.js file and swap out the pid and vid at the top for yours.\nNow, back in Extensions, click the load unpacked extension and select your file.\nLastly, you'll need the capacitor on the reset line as described above because the Extension will want to reset the board.\nNow head to http://hq.pinocc.io It should find your device, decide its out of date, and hopefully successfully contact the bootloader to upload a new Bootstrap copy (hence the need for us to have a working fuel guage since we don't have room to comment anything out here)\nLet me know if you get this to work, as again, I haven't!\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/advanced-pinoccio/","title":"Advanced Pinoccio"},"https://citizengadget.com/altering-new-soft-serial-nss-for-9-bit-cans-of/":{"body":"It looked like I should just be able to alter newsoftserial.cpp and newsoftserial.h  to take a uint_16 instead of 8, and then just step over 9 bits instead of 8 and I should have a pretty simple solution for RX.\n\nMy first problem is NSS sadly virtualizes print so need to break stock install in order to move forward. I don't like it but for now I'm going to continue. I can alter hardwareserial.h and print.h to take the uint_16 as well and I'm good.\nAnother problem I found was NSS doesn't seem to properly (or fully?) implement print.  Neither dec, hex, bin are working to get raw data out, its always ascii format.  In researching I've found .write will do binary in both the print library, and nss, but nss has it marked private.  Found a forum post on adafruit where the writer of NSS claimed he was making .write public 3 years ago. Hah.\nI believe I've come up with an elegant change to the NSS code to step over an arbitrary number of bits, making the code eventually able to support up to 16 bit serial if you'd want to. In the original code they simply shift left a binary 1 and use that as the mask for the bit to write, eventually shifting the 1 off the 8 bit number exiting the loop.\nfor (byte mask = 0x01; mask; mask &lt;&lt;= 1)\n{\n  if (b &amp; mask) // choose bit\n    tx_pin_write(LOW); // send 1\n  else\n    tx_pin_write(HIGH); // send 0\n\n  tunedDelay(_tx_delay);\n}\n\ntx_pin_write(LOW); // restore pin to natural state\n\nI decided with a small change I could create a definable mask which could fit in this system\nuint16_t limit = 0x200; // 9 would be x200, 10 would be x400\n\nfor (uint16_t mask = 0x0001; mask&lt;limit; mask &lt;&lt;= 1)\n{\n  if (b &amp; mask) // choose bit\n    tx_pin_write(LOW); // send 1\n  else\n    tx_pin_write(HIGH); // send 0\n\n  tunedDelay(_tx_delay);\n}\n\ntx_pin_write(LOW); // restore pin to natural state\n\nSo, does it work?

They distrust and dislike their government the same as we distrust ours--and they're pretty vocal about how stupid and corrupt the whole fucking shell game is. Sound like anywhere else in the world? There is no such thing as communism or capitalism in the 21st century global economy. Don't get too smug about your freedom in an age of global terrorism, indefinite wars, patriot acts, and the NDAA. All governments seek to control their peoples interactions 'for the greater good.'\nSo  how was it living under the repression of The Great Firewall?\nIt's there, it sucks. The firewall and VPN slow everything down to a crawl where the internet isn't already slow or over-saturated anyway. The sad thing to report is it's effective. Even smart people I talked to at hackerspaces obviously knew about VPNs, and had used them to get around the firewall, but for their day to day use it was way too much of a pain in the ass for them to actually load one up. Non savvy types I talked to understood vaguely that there were sites they couldn't see but it didn't matter to them. This actually brought about a revelation, which is that the Great Firewall is as much or more for business reasons at this point, as censorship. Why would anyone go through the trouble of loading a firewall to see Twitter or Facebook when their friends are all on Weibo and Douban? Who needs Paypal, you can pay your rent on Alipay. Need to get to Amazon/Ebay/Etsy? Oh thats called Taobao here.\nDid we feel safe [from petty crime]?\nDefinitely. The cities really felt entirely open to us. We weren't warned against any districts and we walked (and occasionally stumbled) home at all hours of the night through hutongs that were dimly if at all lit. Our helpful guides explained that it wasn't that there isn't crime, but for whatever reason everybody prefers to leave Westerners the hell alone.\nDid we feel safe [from the government]?\nAgain yes. Yes we're terrible 'hackers', but they did ok all of our visas. And Mitch's message really wasn't particularly radical--mainly bringing news of the death of the western economy, not the eastern. The most radical message was to quit your job and to not live for your parents or your country but to live for yourself and that THAT was the way that you could ultimately help your country and your parents most. Further nobody we talked to refused to answer our direct questions about political or other issues or talk about how dumb, corrupt, and slow moving they thought their governments were.\nWhat was my biggest revelation?\nThe Tourism industry isn't for westerners... like at all. Its for the Chinese. Someone would talk about how some district was all (puke) tourists. Inevitable I'd end up there, and it was FUCKING SWAMPED with Asians! Maybe you'd see one other westerner get swept past you in the flow of people and you'd make brief eye contact before losing them in the crowd. Theres a billion of the fucking Chinese and they've been working hard for 20 years and they want to see their own god damn temples and lakes and mountains!\nWhat was the worst (most annoying) thing?\nMany things. First, everybody smokes EVERYWHERE. Something like 80% of their population must smoke. Second, there is often no paper towel --or occasionally napkins or toilet paper. Also the 'anarchy' of the place was really annoying. I've never seen a more capitalist people than the Chinese. It was interesting to see how the 'a united china' propaganda on that side of the ocean is actually targeted at them, not us. The government is trying to keep one billion people generally calm in a society that appears to be largely built on a 'it's every man for himself' attitude. There is definitely no respect for lines, which really annoyed my German DNA. Even if the line is generally forming, a couple assholes are in front slyly attempting to cut directly there.\nAlso I hate Chinese food, but that was my problem, not anyone else's.\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/another-white-guy-spends-30-days-in-china-and/","title":"Another white guy spends 30 days in China and thinks he knows things (or China Q/A)"},"https://citizengadget.com/automated-build-testing-for-arduino-libraries/":{"body":"So much can go wrong between your code and the Arduino in the real world. Its vital to keep removing the possible errors in this chain. The lowest hanging fruit we're missing in the Arduino community is testing. We should really be unit testing our code logic to see that it does exactly what we think it does, but until that day we can do something even simpler. We can test that our code actually builds!\n\nTo see a working example, check out one of my libraries called NullStream. Its goofy but useful library that creates a Serial object that doesn’t actually do anything with data you .write to it. /dev/null for Arduino. You’ll notice the only difference from a regular Arduino library on Github is the .travis.yaml file. I’m using a free service called Travis to monitor my repo and when it sees new code create a server to do whatever I want! As of Arduino ~1.5.2 you've actually been able to build Arduino code from the command line, so we ask Travis to download Arduino, move some stuff around, and try to build our code.\nTo get setup on your own repo follow the Travis getting started guide to sign in and enable Travis on your Github profile. When you get to step three you'll need a .travis.yaml file, grab my Arduino command line Travis testing example. Travis have a nice guide explaining the configuration file.\nAt the very least you’ll need to change NAME=NullStreamExample to NAME=Whatever your example sketch is called. Note: This example doesn’t download any non Arduino libraries (except for the one under test) -- If your library depends another library take a look at the .travis.yaml file and try to use wget to download and 'install' another library. Save the file to your Github repo as .travis.yaml, git add it, commit and push, and check your dashboard to watch Travis work its magic.\nIf you have a build error don’t fret. There are build logs you can examine for the error message.\n\nTests should only take a few minutes. If they’re taking longer and timing out thats Arduino failing silently and hanging open because some build option or path was incorrect. You sadly just need to keep trying different options until you can get it to tell you something useful. When you're all done re-commit and repeat until its all ironed out.\nOnce you get everything working, it is really nice to show your users by adding a status badge. Follow the directions to find your generated markdown text and paste it to the top of your README.md file.\n\nIn the future if you push code that doesn’t work Travis will email you and that badge will turn red alerting you something is wrong. As we said, there is a lot more we could do, but this is a great start.\nSo, now you can guarantee your code builds on an Arduino Uno. But lately there are 10s of Arduino models, what about those?  Some Arduino’s have more or less memory, or more or less Serial ports or different architectures like Microchip or Arm. Do you know which boards your code supports? For extra credit you could change the configuration file to check that your code builds on a bunch of them!\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/automated-build-testing-for-arduino-libraries/","title":"Automated Build Testing for Arduino Libraries"},"https://citizengadget.com/back-from-china-and-hong-kong-and-now-on-tumblr/":{"body":"\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/back-from-china-and-hong-kong-and-now-on-tumblr/","title":"Back from China (and Hong Kong) and now on Tumblr."},"https://citizengadget.com/basic-eagle-cad-workflow-and-gotchas-from-heatsync/":{"body":"\n    \n    \n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/basic-eagle-cad-workflow-and-gotchas-from-heatsync/","title":"Basic Eagle CAD workflow and gotchas from HeatSync Labs Hot Topics series"},"https://citizengadget.com/body-computing-goes-mainstream-as-jawbone/":{"body":"Today, with the announcement of availability of the Up fitness band, I believe Jawbone has signaled their intent to become a strong competitor in the Quantified Self and body computing market.\nThe Up, available Nov 6, will log body movement and, along with the already released iPhone app, allow you to track food intake and sleep patterns. It even includes a vibrating alert to wake you during the optimal sleep cycle! It end runs Apples notoriously stingy hardware certification by utilizing the headphone jack to transmit data to the app, not unlike the Square reader.\nWe finally have the answer to the question Venturebeat asked in July question when Jawbone announced they raised a new round of funding totaling $70M, \"Why Now?\" Now because none of the other entrants in the Quantified Self market have the ecosystem, design sense and engineering ability to sell body computing to the masses like Jawbone does today.\nWith the Era's app platform and (still unreleased) API), it's ability to connect to multiple bluetooth devices, and this (displayless) bluetooth sensor, it is now clear Jawbone intends to release a suite of body computing products.

Eventually we hope piercing and other body modification technologies will allow us to do permanent attachment, but despite recent articles on people using sub-dermal for the task, they're are WAY to prone to rejection to think about hanging things off of them. Sub-dermal magnets, too, come up short currently as they destroy the skin when paired with an external magnets/ferrous objects.\nSo what we needed was a double sided adhesive that stuck well to FR4 PCB boards, had a foam type carrier (ie it was thick) so some electronics could sit flush, and was something we handle and package reliably.\n\nTLDR - You can't beat medical grade adhesives from 3M. They stick more reliably than anything else, and can be reapplied if they are removed. We sampled basically all of them and found them frankly equal for our purposes. However, only one had a foam carrier, good old 4133 med spec tape packets pk000023198. (update: these used to be called 3M Venture #7432M and you can actually find them by googling for that) After you sample they'll refer you to a 'converter' who will actually die cut and or sell it to you, though we still haven't been able to get a quote out of our local converter.\nThere were other adhesives worth mentioning but which didn't fit our application for whatever reason.\nWe tried everything from the hardware store. Largely they didn't work well at all:\n\n3M foam tape. Seems to be rubber and acrylic versions if you dig deep enough. Acrylic is way more common and might have seemed stronger, but not by much. Digikey stocks 4026, the stronger version, which we liked best of the hardware store tapes.\n3M VHB is also apparently acrylic, but didn't work well for us.\nCarpet tape from hardware store didn't work at all either.\n\nTheres also toupee tapes/bra tapes which all seem to be identical. They're very thin double sided tapes but worked very well. Im not sure how different from any other double sided tape from Staples, so thats left as an exercise for the reader. They claim they're hypoallergenic so the adhesive is probably not latex.\n\nVapon Topstick\nHollywood Fashion Tape\n\nWe also tried every kind of prosthetics/medical adhesives we could get our hands on. All had a similar issue for us of being unwieldy to package and apply, but would work great for any other application:\n\nPros-aide, Pro adhesive or Reel Magic (a hundred names for the same product) - a prosthetics glue used in costuming and makeup. Its thick and milky like paste. A good hold. Most claim to be latex free/hypoallergenic.\nTensive - A conductive gel (might be interesting for some application?) normally used for TENS/TEMs devices. Had a pretty good hold.\nOsto-bond - Latex based so some people, surprisingly including me, might be allergic. Was pretty good though otherwise.\nSkin tac. Very thin and watery. Leaves a tacky membrane to stick things to that wasn't as strong as other options, but could be good for plastics or something.

It didn't seem like it would be too hard or expensive since square gives out readers by the handful for free. I was only mildly familiar with the technology so I turned to wikipedia who told me the data is stored on Looks like track 1, format b.\nA quick search on Sparkfun for an existing solution found their offerings to be HUGE and expensive! We wanted to embed some solution in a phone size package. Why is square able to make them so small and give them out free? Thus began my journey to destroy every card reader out there.\nSQUARE\n\n\nFirst a little googling led to a teardown of the original square reader. I still tore mine apart anyway and found the same thing they found. The reader is literally a tapehead positioned perfectly to hit track 1, nothing more! Not even an amp!  Basically they did as much in software as they possibly could. Good job!\nWe wouldn't be using a phone jack in our solution and wouldn't have much processing power for cleaning the signal, but we spent some time trying to amp the signal and read the data. The signal was clearly evident and ampable, but our timeline didn't include reinventing card readers.\nMuch later in my research I actually found an amazing talk from the Square engineers which explains everything. Its a must watch.\nIn my research I found that Square had actually updated their model to add encryption. The update was touted for security, but I have trouble believing someone could man in the middle your headphone jack. A much more likely reason is using encryption to lock out the rise of the copycat mobile payment solutions like Intuit and Paypal. And of course to stop people like me from tracking down and repurposing handfuls of them.\n\nWe surveyed our friends and found one of them in the wild to crack open. Sure enough theres now a coin cell battery and TI micro in there and the signal is nonsense.\nINTUIT (circle)\n\nThe first Intuit reader I took apart was THEIR v1 as well.\n\nIt used a e42407bj from Magchip and a f1936 from Microchip that seemed to either be for encryption. Some digging from my partner Tim turned up a similar part at IDTech that was very close to what we had which showed it actually output serial! Clearly they were simply in a rush to get to market and repurposed some existing silicon. Pricey for them, good for us.\nI tried to locate more readers for cheap, but they were on their v2 now.\n\nWhen I finally tracked one down and tore it apart they'd transitioned off the Magchip chip for a custom solution with encryption :(\n\n\nSo close!!!\nThe PAYPAL  (triangle)\n\nThe Triangle is the most beautiful device of the bunch. The front cover is actually removable -- presumably for rebranding? The case, however, is impossible to get open. You can see my hacksaw damage in the photo above.\n\n\nInside it looks a lot like these other second gen readers though with a ton more passive components. We've got a 8L151G ST Micro and an op amp package 6l04ste from Microchip. Presumably reading the signal and encrypting it for their app.\nAgain it makes this device not at all hackable and shows nobody going into this business at this point is going to leave their devices open any more.\nMAGTEK\nAt this point Tim just looked up magchip readers and we found another company called Magtek. It turns out they actually have a fully implemented chip and tape head solution that outputs RS232. They're something like $15-25 in low qty which meant if we were doing anything other than a functional prototype they'd be no good, but they would fit our custom solution just fine. We were able to successfully implement the Magtek solution with no real problems and were very happy with the responsiveness. Sadly I didn't write the code, so if you want to see it please hassle Tim into posting the code he wrote so you can benefit from our work too!\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/card-reader-roundup-and-teardown/","title":"Card Reader Roundup and Teardown"},"https://citizengadget.com/fakerbot-lives/":{"body":"[This post is from our 3dprinting wiki and is being added here and backdated for completeness]\nThe machine is called a FakerBot, because it's not quite a MakerBot, but there is a direct lineage. Since we didn't have access to a laser-cutter and we wanted to do it on the cheap, the frame was slightly redesigned by Corey so that it could be cut on a tablesaw from inch material. The tongue and groove construction was replaced with dado-cut slots. All holes were made with a 7/8\" forstner bit, this allows them to take a skate bearing (a paper shim is required) or anything else that we wanted through the use of adapter plates since we knew that mods were likely. Total cost of the enclosure was $13 for a sheet of 1/4\" (actually 5.2mm) Luan from Home Despot which provided enough material to make four FakerBots even though we only made one. A laser-cut frame would have cost about $200 form Makerbot, so we saved a lot here. The frame was finished with linseed oil and came out pretty nice. MakerBot specified precision shafting for the X&amp;Y axis which is unnecessary for a low-tech motion control system like this one. Drill rod was substituted for all linear shafting at a total cost of about $3 which is another $20 or $30 reduction. Similarly, low-cost nylon bushings were substituted for the more expensive MakerBot spec'd parts. The X and Y stages on the MakerBot are pretty good aside from being too tall, however the Z-stage is a horrible design. It is overly complex, wobbly, prone to jamming, etc. A replacement z-stage was designed by Corey with the goal of making Z simple and reliable:\nThe following parts from the Makerbot design were removed:\n\n(1) Belt\n(8) Bearings\n(1) Driving Pulley\n(4) Driven Pulleys\n(2) Idler Pulleys\n(1) Platform\n(2) Extruder Mounts (Dragons)\n(4) All-thread Rods (leadscrews)\n(4) Driven nuts (leadnuts)\nassorted screws and hardware\n\nThat giant steaming pile of hardware was replaced with:\n\n(1) 1/4-20 Acme leadscrew\n(1) Antibacklash nut\n(1) shaft coupler\n(1) Cantilever arm (laser cut)\n(1) Linear rail\n(1) Truck for linear rail\n\nAn overall reduction from (27) functional components down to (6) !\nIf you count every nut and screw the reduction is far greater, but you get the idea. The new Z-stage is a big improvement and has eleminated all of the jamming and wobbling problems that we had previously. It also looks far better.\nThe extruder is Corey's design hosted at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579. It is a clean-sheet of paper design that sprang from the frustration of dealing with the shortcomings of other extruders. So far the CoreyStruder and its derivatives have been downloaded on Thingiverse over 250 times.\nThe hot-end is Corey's copy of the hot-end used on the UP! printer which he later discovered is actually a copy of Nophead's design. It is very compact and works well.

The grant concept was a \"Desert Playground\" which we ended up interpreting as a series of interactive cactuses utilizing Southwest Scrap Exchange creative reuse.\n\nWe brainstormed several different cactus concepts (my favorite that didn't make it was a tumbleweed style cactus via a hamster ball prototype ) but I mainly worked on a motion sensitive pool noodle agave (above)\nThe whole project was incredibly price sensitive and for a long time I couldn’t figure out how to afford enough motion sensors to enable interactivity in so many leaves. Tim Gerrits ended up inventing a very clever cheap motion switch based on a spring, copper tube and ball bearing.\n\nWith so much wiring I wanted clean consistent connections so I fabbed a mosfet driver screw shield to break out an Arduino Mega for its large amount GPIO. I brainstormed with Jasper a simple fall off algorithm that loaded a random number into an array upon motion, then just slowly shifted the bits off until the cactus eventually settled back to stillness. We also added an attract mode so it would freak out if left alone too long.\nThe Prickly Pear was the last to come together and became much more art the science.\n\nWe developed a concept of ‘flowers’ that would slowly ‘die out’ when plucked. I wound coils and hid them in the agave paddles and wired them down to the same mosfet power shield we used in the Agave.\n\nThen I wound another coil around 20oz plastic bottles ‘flowers’. I swapped out caps until I had decent coupling to transfer enough power to light up an led from ~6 inches away.\nGrant based art work is incredibly grueling and I gained a lot of appreciation for those hustling a livelihood or donating their time for work on stuff like this.

Setting anything else very well may take your bean offline or worse..\nOther than that I just added Bean.sleep at the end of loop to allow bean to sleep for power saves. Adjust to taste.\nBesides resolving the pin mapping, theres plenty to be done to make this a full port. There should be a more clear Firmata Boards.h entry to show the true available pins, and in Standard firmata we might look to protect other pins from being touched. I also havent tested servo/pwm/etc functionality, especially with the sleep addition...\nNote -- I've been using firmata.js for my Node firmata needs but we've found some problems with how chatty it is out of the box. It was designed for a serial cable world and we're quickly moving past that, though our PRs arent being accepted.  @monteslu has a firmata.js fork up that we're now using exclusively\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/firmata-on-lightblue-bean/","title":"Firmata on LightBlue Bean"},"https://citizengadget.com/firmata-on-spark-core/":{"body":"\nPhoto Gareth Halfacree.\nAs part of my work with the soon to be launched Octoblu I've been working on porting Firmata over to Spark Core. The Spark's arduino abstraction has really come along making it the cheapest connected arduino out there, and me pretty excited about it.\n\nA firmata will allow us to command and control our sparks from all the existing firmata interfaces out there like Johnny 5 in Node or the many native interfaces. I should note Chris Williams has Voodoo Spark https://github.com/voodootikigod/voodoospark which is an RPC replacement for Firmata on Spark. From the Readme\n\"The VoodooSpark uses the Spark Cloud and its REST API to provide IP address and port information to the local spark core. It will then initiate a direct connection to the host machine, on which will need to be a TCP server. Once the connection has been made, the host machine can drive the Spark Core using the binary protocol defined below to effectively execute firmware API level commands dynamically.\"\nThat being said not relying on the Spark server or requiring you to have a TCP Server seemed like enough to bring Firmata over. Plus Ive been able to do things like tunnel firmata through mqtt which would allow Core sleep and store and forward messages that VoodoSpark currently couldnt achieve.\nUPDATE: Firmata has forked the project for the Spark and I'm developing in dev at https://github.com/firmata/spark#dev with production being at https://github.com/firmata/spark\nWhile a full working branch of octoblu (nea skynet) mqtt and core-firmware is over at\nhttps://github.com/jacobrosenthal/core-firmware/tree/skynet-mqtt-firmata\nThe branch is working for minor interactions, but theres still a bit to be done.\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/firmata-on-spark-core/","title":"Firmata on Spark Core"},"https://citizengadget.com/geotagged-gopro-photos-via-eyefi/":{"body":"\nTLDR;\nWe now have geotagged photos and our uploads occur automatically at the end of the day via ftp! Thanks EyeFi!\n\nI bought the new EyeFI pro x2 today mainly because it supports FTP and wifi geotagging. We figured we might be able to get some of these features 'free' without designing them into our board right this minute.\nIdeally it would be fun to have live shots of us as we go through our day, a lot like our hackerspace cam were you can see whats up with everyone at the lab.\nIn our testing it still takes at least 30 seconds and often more like 45 to get a single shot uploaded. I've found I can upload 0-3 photos within a minute depending on network congestion. However, the EyeFI does successfully get SSID data for geotag within our usual ~8 seconds on period! Note: The geo tagging happens at the server side where they appear to use skyhook. They add your GPS exif data and send it on to whatever service you've configured, ftp, flickr,etc. so you have to 'upload' it to get the exif data.\nWe want to avoid being on more than a minute, because the GoPro will take another photo because its intervalometer mode were (which takes a photo a max of once every 60 sec when you turn the camera on-- we just turn it off)\nThe next problem is we would have to be on wifi at all times. Sadly the EyeFI uploads OLDEST first, which means if we miss an upload window we'll get further and further behind in our uploading. If we could get the EyeFI to upload the NEWEST we could sidestep that issue until charge time.\nOne option to maintain wifi all day is tethering to a data plan, but we're looking at 1.5GB data a day generally. I'm already a heavy data user getting throttled so that probably won't work. Ideally it would be best if we could upload thumbnails throughout the day and do a full dump at night, but again not an option with the EyeFI, nor does the GoPro generate thumbnails (except maybe in exif data?). There are other EyeFI style cards nowadays. Specifically we're looking into the FLU card which runs some kind of embedded linux with scripts, perhaps we can control more there?\nBut for now, were just going save to the EyeFI all day (probably with some battery hit while it scans for SSIDs) and at the end of the day plug the card into the pc allowing uploads and tagging to occur all night while we sleep (though limiting our ability to cam our sleep).\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/geotagged-gopro-photos-via-eyefi/","title":"Geotagged GoPro photos via EyeFi"},"https://citizengadget.com/goertzel-arduino-library/":{"body":"For my ongoing Arduino watch project, we want to be able to do frequency detection in order to blink an led to bass hits.\nThere are a few Fast Fourier Transforms that have been written on Arduino including this one and this one. However, I needed my library to run on 8mhz clock along with whatever sampling rate change that would introduce. All the libraries I found were extremely optimized or poorly written with no abstraction so that I found it easier to start from scratch than attempt to use them.\nSo I set about figuring out how to implement something myself. I quickly learned about something called the Goertzel algorithm for when you actually only need to find a single frequency, vs a whole range, allowing all the savings you would expect from that. I found a few generic implementations of that as well on wikipedia and EEtimes but nothing specifically for Arduino. I tried implementing the generalized version on wikipedia but had lots of trouble with datatypes and my ability to properly debug on Arduino hardware. The EE times implementation's link was broken but some google-fu found it the demo code. It was written in C that I could compile on my laptop and get sane results. Then I could move it to Arduino slowly while maintaining those sane results. With this method I was able to keep everything working as I transitioned the code to a full Goertzel Arduino library.\nI'm looking for feedback on how it should be implemented. Should it do the sample, or work on your existing array of samples? Is there an easier way to expose N and target frequency, perhaps some calculation or default? Let me know!\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/goertzel-arduino-library/","title":"Goertzel Arduino Library"},"https://citizengadget.com/hackaday-superconference-badge-hacking/":{"body":"\nAt the Hackaday Superconference this year Blaine and I finally decided to try our hand at a conference badge puzzle. The cambadge was introduced a month before the conference with the source code following shortly after so you you could prepare hack ideas and even start prototyping shields and addons. In their words:\n\nIt’s a camera. It has games, and it’s designed by [Mike Harrison] of Mike’s Electric Stuff. He designed and prototyped this badge in a single weekend. On board is a PIC32 microcontroller, an OV9650 camera module, and a bright, crisp 128×128 resolution color OLED display.\n\n\nThere would be prizes for best hardware hack, best app hack and even a film fest prize. But most importantly, there was also a puzzle prize. The puzzle firmware was implemented by Mike Szczys with the ciphers being developed by Jeff Rosowski (Krux).\nNavigating to the puzzle menu revealed three options in binary, 00, 01, 10.\n\n00 was some graphical 'game', 01 appeared to be a reciting of the hacker's manifesto, and 10 was a ouija board. That's all the information we were given.\nPUZZLE 00\n\nWe halfheartedly played with the 00 puzzle while trying to be social during the pre party and started to put together a ruleset. A green cursor could be moved around an 8x8 grid by tilting the accelerometer. One button seemed to ‘place’ a red circle under the cursor. Further placements that shared a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) would light up the row in orange.\n\nThis was presumably a failure scenario but it was puzzling that we still had control of the cursor. A very jetlagged Scotty from StrangeParts got six placements before giving it up and handing it back, suggesting to google it or write a script to solve it. We finally figured out the failure screen allows you to remove a failed placement and continue the game. This allowed us to put down a random six placements and continue taking back movements until we had all eight which went surprisingly quickly. In just a few minutes and roughly five take backs we had \"Winner Winner!\" printed on screen.\n\nSuspiciously, the menu screen also now has a set of hieroglyphic symbols under the 00 menu item. In googling later, we’d find out later this is a Queens Puzzle and we got a bit lucky. Theres 92 possible solutions but our methodology is called iterative repair and does not guarantee a solution.\nPUZZLE 10\n\nWe talked to John Dahan who won last year by using the strings command on the binary to find the success email to skip all puzzles. Strings is a common utility that prints all ascii characters it can find in a binary. We talked to Mike who said that wasn't going to work this year, but were were undeterred. Before even bothering to understand the puzzle ruleset we just started looking at the scrubbed source and production hex file. The source was definitely missing the puzzles, though we did get a dist folder with intact elf files. That could come in very handy and also means we don’t have to install MPLAB-X IDE ide to generate it myself. The .hex file was strange though. Generally .hex are intel hex format, ie ascii hex code representation with checksumming, but this was a binary. We wasted a bunch of time here remembering obj-copy stuff, only to realize we weren’t gaining anything and this was indeed a binary we could utilize as is. Running \"strings Badge103.hex\" output the results in this gist.\nAfter entering eight letters into ouija board the screen reads \"What was that?\" and appears to tell you which letters you had right by \"X\"ing out incorrect letters.\n\nThis would be super easy in retrospect, but hacking was way more fun. We searched the strings list for \"What was that\" hoping to find any suspicious text around it.\n&gt; $ strings Badge103.hex  | grep -A 5 \"What was that\"\n&gt; What was that?\n&gt; HACKADAY\n&gt; MARKUSHESS\n&gt; None\n&gt; Not found\n&gt; Read Err\n\nHACKADAY is indeed eight characters which when entered was answered with \"The planchette moves by itself:\" and the code \"PNIRHJZYL GSIXDF WFDNXJF JH CZDRI.\"\n\nToo lazy to bother cracking the cipher we entered \"MARKUSHESS.\" Though we still have no idea how to crack this code, Markus was the hacker from Clifford Stoll’s The Cuckoo's Egg so we weren’t surprised to receive an egg image.\n\nWe were subsequently kicked back out to the puzzle menu now with more symbols.\n\nPUZZLE 01\n\nThe puzzle consists of twenty-seven lines of the Hacker’s Manifesto where you must scroll each line left or right to read it on the tiny screen. For some reason the cursor always starts at the fourth line which seems odd. At the bottom there is a list of twenty-seven negative and positive numbers with a four alpha character input to presumably complete the puzzle.\n\nIt seems obvious that the list of numbers maps to the lines of the manifesto. We looked to see if aligning the rows might spell a question in far right or left column that we could answer with four characters, but couldn't see anything obvious.\n\nIt was a huge pain to click buttons and invariably the badge would turn off or we’d get distracted and lose our place. We glanced through the strings dump for anything that might make sense for puzzle 10, but didn't see anything this time. As the party was ending we spent time running down mysterious QR codes that showed up around the venue thinking they could be related somehow, but were thrown out before we could get more than a few.\n\nLater we woudl find there was a (seperate) prize that unlocked on the badge if you scanned all ten of the mysterious QR codes sprinkled throughout the venues.\nThe next day we were bored looking at puzzles and wanted to do more reverse engineering. I've been looking for a reason to get better with Radare forever. Radare lets you snoop through binaries, disassemble them, rebuild the function graph, and even edit the code in place! So not unlike a crackme, we could presumably find the code that prints Winner, backtrace to find the branching instruction that decides success, and hardcode it to so that when we enter the game it gives us the winner screen. TLDR feel free to skip this section as we didn’t get anywhere, but we would love guidance to be better at this for the next conference.\nHUGE DIVERSION AHEAD\nRadare has a bit of a learning curve, as described by a slide from a recent talk from the founding developer, pancake.\n\nWe can open our binary file in Radare and analyze it for functions, printing the results.\n$ r2 -a mips -e asm.bits=32 Badge103.hex\nWARNING: bin_strings buffer is too big (0x02bf8a80).

We can even visualize a complete call graph.\n\nBut remember, we know this has all our puzzles stripped so there won’t be much to see here. What we want is this view in our puzzle inclusive binary. Why doesn't our binary ‘hex’ file load cleanly into Radare? Presumably the elf file has a bunch of debug info like sections and entry point (reset vector) to help set up Radare automatically which we don’t understand how to do manually. So how do we help it? In our production dist files we also have a .map file that has the function names and addresses in it.

Anyone reading this please reach out if you can help us understand Radare better for the next conference.\nBack on track\nA day lost, we went back to solving it the honest way -- sort of. Blaine wasn’t even an official attendee so we were having to share a badge. Since we were armed with the strings dump of the manifesto text and list of integes we turned to node to script something to print the columns so we could maybe see what we couldn’t see with our own eyes.\nStill, nothing looked right and we went down a hundred other rabbit holes that didn't work out, all the while begging Krux and Mike for any guidance. Finally when the conference ceremony was just hours away Krux helped us find our script had an off by one error. With that fixed it turns out all this time a middle column read \"realbunniehuanghardwarehack\" Bunnie was perhaps first known for hacking the xbox. \"Winner Winner!\"\nA Fourth Puzzle\n\nNow we had a third set of hieroglyphs and \"badge17@hackaday.com\". To be fair we saw this email in the strings earlier, so we're pretty sure we'd be seeing it again. But what were these glyphs?\nSeveral, especially the last one sure looks like unicode but we couldn’t find many of the rest. We spent a lot of time on that before asking Krux who didn't seem interested in that line of reasoning. We decided to do a transposition arbitrarily to the english alphabet just to play with the characters. Transposing the first character to a, and so one, we got \"abcde fgahidjkclefg gmgce ccgcm nkeopfi\" There were only 16 distinct 'letters', with c, g, and e being highest in frequency. However this tiny subset of text just doesn't lend to any kind of frequency analysis. We spent a lot of time thinking the spaces were useful and that \"ccgcm\" would be an odd word with double repeated starting letter. Llama didn’t seem likely, but you never know. We looked at brute forcing rot, morse and other symbol alphabets but didn’t come up with anything that worked before we finally ran out of time.\nDuring the badge ceremony one other team had apparently also got this far and was awarded some cash for their efforts. Mike and Krux spoiled the last puzzle on stage, it's apparently the Commander Keen, Standard Galactic Alphabet. When translated it reads: \"PRESTONPLUSWHEATONNINETEENEIGHTYFOUR\" which is a Last Starfighter reference. Presumably emailing \"Last Starfighter\" to badge17@hackaday.com would have won us the that sweet $256 prize.\nNext time\nHuge thanks to everyone involved at Superconference. It was a crazy lineup of amazing speakers. It was also awesome to see so much money given away to the Hackaday prize entrants I had been bumping into all weekend. Huge thanks to Mike and Krux for getting us to commit to a badge puzzle for the first time and for helping us through to the (very) end.\n\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/hackaday-superconference-badge-hacking/","title":"Hackaday Superconference Badge Hacking"},"https://citizengadget.com/history-of-the-world-part-1/":{"body":"Around October of 2009 HeatSync began planning to build a 3d printer as one of our first community projects.

We visited five hackerspaces, two Maker Faires, Seeed Studios, factories and lots more! I asked Mitch a series of questions about how the trip came about, what he saw, his thoughts on traveling to a country with a poor human rights record, and what madness he's up to next!\nWhat is this China trip thing? Where did you go?\n\nThis is my second Hacker Trip To China.  After hearing about a trip to China that Bunny Huang (of Chumby, and otherwise open source hardware guru) organized, and seeing how people involved loved it so much, I invited hackers from around the world to go with me on my (mostly) annual trip to China to visit my manufacturer.  That was the end of 2009.  At that point, there were no hackerspaces in China.  When I went to China in April-2010, there were two hackerspaces.  And, of course, I visited them.  And met lots of way cool people.  Which I connected.  And got them excited to do their own Maker Faire type event in Beijing.  And poked lots of people relentlessly to encourage them to start their own hackerspace.  One year later, there are 6 hackerspaces in China, with more being planned.  I invited 8 people to travel with me to again visit my manufacturer, but also to go to every city in China with a hackerspace (Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and two in Beijing), culminating with the big Maker Carnival in Beijing.  But, a few months before our trip, Seeed Studio, who I visited last year, got their Shenzhen Mini Maker Faire going, and they scheduled it so that our Hacker Trip To China would be in Shenzhen during their Faire.  We were shown around by local geeks everywhere we went.  And we got to see some manufacturing in process so that we can get a feel for how many of the things we use in our day-to-day-lives come into being.  And, of course, we got to do cultural and tourist things as well.\nHow does a trip like this come together?\nLots of organizing on my part!  Putting out the word (on hackerspaces.org, and other hackerspace email lists, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Diaspora) with enough advanced warning so that those who are interested can go; communicating with people well ahead of time to ensure that we had housing taken care of, as well as cool things to see and do; and booking and paying for all the hotels and transportation between cities (knowing that I'd get paid back by the folks after we met in China).\nWhat would you expect to get from this trip?\nI travel a lot.  And usually when I travel somewhere, I have one main thing planned, and leave most of the rest up to serendipity and adventure.  In this way I meet the coolest people.  And I connect many of them together whenever it seems they could benefit from some form of collaboration.  When traveling with a group, we all get to learn from one another as we get to know each other.  China is the place where most adventure just seems to come together so easily.  China is changing so fast at this point in history.  It is exciting to be there and see and feel it happening, as well as be a small part of that change.\nWhat do you think the people you visited (hackerspaces, etc) got from the trip?\nI hope they were inspired to explore more of their creativity.  And I really hope at least some were inspired to explore and do what they love!  China has historically been a place where (in general) creativity has been stifled.  But right now, things are really opening up there.  And there people in and out of government are pushing, in their own ways, for people to explore their creativity, for without this, China's economic future is in question, and with it, it seems ensured.  I also hope that more people were inspired to start more hackerspaces.  When I go back next year, I expect that there will be lots more!  There will probably be more Maker Faire-like events.  And, I am excited to see the positive growth.\nWhat are your responsibilities on the trip? How do you wrangle all these people?\nI'm an anarchist at heart.  I'm also good at wrangling.  But, I'm way lazy.  Fully organizing everything to small details takes way too much work!  But, not only that, but it gets in the way things moving in a way that might be much better for the individuals in the group, and thus, the group.  I see my responsibilities as giving people enough info so that they can enjoy their trip the most -- such as letting people know how to get a Chinese visa, and where to book plane flights, suggestions for itineraries each day, and making sure people know what time our transportation will be leaving for our next destination -- but staying out of the way so that individuals and the group can decide what to do.  I want everyone to put in as much energy as they want into making the trip that they want.\nWho are they? Did you know them before? How did you put them together? Did they know eachother?\nExcept for knowing me, hardly anyone knew each other before the trip -- and two people didn't even know me.  There were people from all over the world:  Yair from Israel (who didn't know anyone on the trip), Simon from Switzerland (who I met at Chaos Congress, an annual hacker conference in Berlin), Tobias from Germany (who I met in 2007 at Chaos Congress), Florian from Germany (also from Chaos Congress, and who's been to Noisebridge a few times), Jonas (from Hong Kong, but who I've been friends for many years, from when he lived in San Francisco), Ursula from San Francisco, Charles from New Orleans (but who met me briefly when he lived in San Francisco), Min Lin from Shanghai (and co-founder of XinCheJian hackerspace there, who I met the week they opened their space last year), and Jacob from Phoenix area (that's you! -- who I met when visiting Phoenix last year when I did a workshop at HeatSync Labs that he co-founded).\nWhat are the accommodations like? What are the costs?\nEverywhere we went the accommodations are somewhat minimal, but clean.  The cost was about $25 per person per night.  All double rooms.\nMy flight was $34.30, because I have so many frequent flyer miles (and that was the fee).  But round trip to China is often as low as $680.  I'm not sure what it would have cost me for this trip (editors note: my flight was ~$1100 USD from Phoenix to San Fran to Hong Kong). My total costs for this trip came to $1,961.71 .  Here's the breakdown:\n     lodging:  $828.59 for 32 nights (~$25/night)\n\n     transportation:  $494.53 (including planes, trains, mass transit, taxis)\n\n     food:  $418.34  (~$13/day)\n\n     phone:  $57.81  (SIM for Hong Kong, SIM for China, plus top-ups for voice, text, data)\n\n     Chinese visa:  $150.84  (visa, plus photos for visa)\n\n     laundry:  $11.60\n\nI also bought a lot of parts for electronic kit-making and playing (not included in the above), plus 2 suitcases to carry the extra parts home:  $484.49\nI also bought 4 custom-made pants and 8 shirts (not included in the above):   $135.12\nI also bought some really good tea (not included in the above):  $23.84\nWhat was the biggest challenge on this trip?\nFor me, the challenge is to keep little bits of meat out of my food -- I'm a vegan.  But that's actually not very difficult in China.  And there's so many fantastic vegetarian restaurants.  I can't actually think of anything that was all that challenging for me.  Perhaps motivating everyone to explore more?  And ensuring that people get along well, or stay out of others way when they don't?  But that wasn't really a problem.  Probably the biggest challenge comes from barely being able to get by in spoken Mandarin, and being almost totally illiterate otherwise.  That is very frustrating.  But even this isn't a huge problem, since our phones can help us, and also Min Lin was way helpful with her fluent Mandarin and fluent English (and her inexhaustible desire to help others).  Also, Ursula has passable Mandarin skills.\nWhat was the most interesting/remarkable/exciting thing?\nI'm excited about a group artist in residence program that is going to happen as a result of visiting Toyhouse, the first hackerspace that is part of a university (and there are about to be many more, which excites me a lot, too!).  As part of encouraging Chinese people to explore their creativity, a group of Westerners are being invited for 1 month, all expenses paid, to go to Petrochemical University in Beijing, learn how to use the way amazing tools available in their labs by students there, then create workshops for students there to be involved with while the group creates projects individually and together.  This will be a pilot program, and if successful, will spread throughout China.\nThe Maker Carnival was also very exciting.  So many way creative projects!\nHow do you do workshops in China. Do they speak english?\nMy workshops go a lot slower in China, since I need to have people translate as I go along (since I can't converse in Mandarin).  Many people at hackerspaces can understand English OK, but it is still better when someone translates from my (somewhat bizarre use of the English language) to Mandarin.\nWhat has been your message as you travel through china to all these hackerspaces and two Makerfaires?\nMy main goal is to inspire people to explore and do what they love!  That is my message everywhere I go.  It is important everywhere.  If we do not explore and do what we love, then we will die never having loved out lives.  And that is just way too sad.  This is an even more important message in China, since there has been so little encouragement of this in their history over the past several centuries.  It is now time for this to change in China!  And it is changing.\nHow do you feel about touring a country like China which has a poor human rights record, censorship, etc? Has there been any political problems?\nI've never had any problems traveling anywhere I travel.  But, I do not go to places to try to force political change.  My message is very positive:  explore and do what you love!  In the case of China, or Egypt (where I was last September), their economies depend on people doing this.  People need to create products and services that are good for their own localities.  If someone explores and does what they love, then others are going to love it, too.  And when people love something, they will pay for it.  And if something becomes popular enough, then people can make a living doing what they love.  And if it is popular enough, then they will need to hire friends, and others from their local community.  And local economy will spread.  And people will have the goods and services they really want.  Governments love this sort of thing.  :)\nI have no problem traveling places with poor human rights records.  I will not help organizations who's values do not align well with mine.  But if I see opportunities for positive change, I will do my best to help.\n**...have you been scared?  **\nI've had very few scary experiences outside of the US.  In the US I've had guns pointed at me, and a few other scary experiences.  But out of the US, the scariest thing that happened to me was in India, where a dog wanted to bite into my lower leg, and almost did, but at the last moment, its owner screamed, and the dog healed.\nDo you censor yourself? Any  Appelbaum style travel problems?\nI've never had anything but officials being polite to me at borders.\nI do not censor myself overtly.  I do tend to express things differently, depending on the audience.  For instance, while talking to you, we may get into a political discussion about how this or that thing about our country really sucks.  This topic isn't something I would have with everyone I meet, and certainly not as a first topic when I do meet someone.  So, this type of discussion isn't my first thing to say to a border protection officer.  And, when talking to a government official in China, the first topic isn't human rights records in their country.\nYou've been to China almost every year for the past how many years? What strikes you as you visit every year? What are your thoughts on china and its future?\nI went to China the first year as a tourist with my mom in 1998.  And I've been going almost every year since I started manufacturing TV-B-Gone remote controls there in 2004.  China is a very different place than in 1998.  It is actually a very different place than even a few years ago.  It is really fascinating to get a snapshot, from my own limited perspective, each year.  China really is opening up in remarkable ways right now.  I have no idea what this brings.  In my rosiest hopes, China will continue along this path, and there will be thousands of hackerspaces within 10 years, and some significant percentage of the billion people in China will be exploring and doing what they love, creating robust local economies all over the place, providing goods and services that people really want and need for a huge majority China.  The worst case is that some people at the top of the bureaucracy get a bit too nervous at the rate of change (or at some occurrences along the way), and it all comes to a grinding halt.  Or, perhaps a more likely negative outcome:  Chinese culture remains staid and constricted, where people continue to live for status and money, and all of the hackerspaces and equipment set up for people to explore their creativity remains mostly unused.  But even if that last scenario is the case, there will at least be some people making use of the available resources.  And if enough do, then it will spread.  Maybe not as fast or as huge as my rosiest hope, but still -- with more opportunities for some large number of people to live lives they truly love.\nHow much time do you spend traveling?\nOver the last few years, I've averaged about half my time at home, and about half my time on the road:  teaching soldering, teaching people how to make things with electronics, workshops, talks, presentations, helping hackerspaces everywhere I go, and poking others to start hackerspaces.\nHow would someone get you to visit them?\nAsk!\nemail:  mitch at CornfieldElectronics dot com\ntwitter:  maltman23\nSkype:  maltman23\nFacebook:  maltman23\nHow would someone else plan a trip like this?\nDo it!\nHow would someone find out about the next trip like this you plan?\nI put the word out on the hackerspaces.org email list, the Noisebridge email list, and other hackerspace email lists.  I also put the word out on my Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Diaspora accounts.  So, follow any or all.\nWhats next?\nHell if I know!  Life is way too weird to plan it in advance and have it be so.  All the same, I do know that I'm going to New Jersey to re-charge 3,500 TV-B-Gone Pro batteries to ensure that no customers get units with batteries that are too weak (they need to be recharged at least once every 6 months -- my original calculations were 12 months -- damn!), and then to Orlando, for a Mini Maker Faire there (to teach Arduino, soldering, and give a talk).\n--edited to fix Mitch's email and my flight details\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/interview-mitch-altmans-hacker-trip-to-china-2/","title":"Interview: Mitch Altman's Hacker Trip to China 2"},"https://citizengadget.com/kicad-to-advanced-circuits-for-pcbs-and-assembly/":{"body":"Advanced circuits is a very high quality United States board house. They have a cheapish PCB service called 33each for small runs, though it generally doesn't compete with OSHPark if you ask me. Its only when you're doing a bunch of boards (~20-50) that they really shine. And, if you're doing boards through them, they offer assembly as well at frankly competitive prices to the DIY alternative Small Batch Assembly.\n\nYou can choose as fast as 2 days, or 20 days with the cost on a sliding scale. For reference, my qty 50 ~1″x1″ nrf51 bluetooth boards were all told under 2k assembled in 5 days. Always check their specials page to take a few hundred off your order, too.\nFor using Kicad for Design for Manufacture, you need to start with this excellent post from Rheingold Heavy which has inline responses from Small Batch.\nAlmost everything in that article is relevant from storing BOM data in eeschema elements, fiducials, to viewing gerbers in gerbview. We’ll talk about exceptions below.\nFor PCBs, sadly Kicad doesn’t have design rules (dru) like Eagle does. Advanced's standard (cheapest) board service, lists tolerances but remember these are all negotiable with a big board house like this! If you need tighter just talk to your rep and see if theres a cost.\nSo for a standard cheap board, with the inches icon on left on, click Design Rules-&gt;Design Rules and for all nets set:\n\nClearance no less than .008″\nTrack width no less than .008″\nVia diameters no less .020″\nVia drill no less than .010″ (ie a 5mil annular ring)\n\nAnother issue that wasn’t caught by FreeDFM initially was board edge clearance. There doesn’t appear to be a way to set this in Kicad, but you need to leave .015″ clearance of pads, vias, AND copper pours in order for them to separate your boards after manufacture and assembly. Make sure to move all your components an zones away from the edge, or just move your board edge back that much on all sides.\nTo generate the gerbers in pcbnew, click plot icon or File-&gt;Plot. This Wayne and Layne post on Gerber generation was super helpful here.\n\nLayers, probably F.Cu (Top Copper), B.Cu(Bottom Copper) F.Paste(Top Solder Paste) F.Silk (Top Silkscreen), B.Silk (Bottom Silkscreen), B.Mask (Bottom soldermask), F.Mask (Top soldermask)\nOptions, You might have other stuff checked, but the important one is to make sure Exclude PCB edge layer from other layers is unchecked as Advanced doesn’t take a separate edge cuts layer. Another nicety is check use auxiliary axis as origin so when you view in gerbview the file is in the center of the screen.\nGerber Options, click Protel filename Options.\nFinally, Click Plot.\n\nNow to generate the drill file, click Generate Drill File.\n\nDrill Units, use inches\nZeros format suppress leading zeros\nDrill Map doesn’t matter\nFiles options uncheck mirror y, use minimal header, and if you have non plated holes, Advanced takes a separate file for plated and non plated so make sure merge pth and npth holes into one file is unchecked.\nDrill Origin Auxiliary axis presuming you used \"auxiliary axis as origin\" in the plot screen.\nFinally, click Drill File then Close and Close and you Gerbers are in your project directory under GerberOutput\n\nAs the Rheingold article mentions, use gerbview to check your designs locally, then zip and upload them to Advanced’s FreeDFM tool for further error and tolerance checking and tweak as needed.\nOne issue that wasn’t caught by FreeDFM was board edge clearance. There doesn’t appear to be a way to set this in Kicad(?), but you need to leave .015″ clearance of pads, vias, AND copper pours from board edges in order for them to separate your boards after manufacture and assembly. Make sure to move all your components an zones away from the edge, or just expand your board size that much on all sides.\nOnce your PCB is looking good, next you’ll need your BOM in excel format. Like in the Rheingold article, use BOM generation in eeschema. But what is different, you’ll need a grouped BOM layout (all like values and parts on same line). Luckily Kicad forum user Wolf wrote a Kicad BOM plugin for that, posted on the Kicad forums as bom2groupedCsv. But you’ll also need it converted to xlsx for your rep. so I wrote a python script for that. Just run it with the only input the name of the BOM (by default is the name of the project no extension) ./csv2xls.py projectname\nFinally you need your placement File-Fabrication Outputs-&gt;position (.pos). They call this a CPL file. Unlike in the article for for Small Batch Assembly you don’t need to change header names or merge any other BOM data on it, Advanced can pivot with the existing Ref, Val, and Package fields just fine. One note though, they don’t currently use the rotation data (Rot), so you need to have your pin1's marked nicely on your PCB silk! Finally, they'll take it columnar tab separated as it comes out of Kicad, so no need to format to xlsx or anything else for this one.\nFinally, you have everything you need. Grab your final revision PCB quote number from FreeDFM, and contact your regional rep via email for an assembly quote. When they reply, also give them your xlsx BOM and .pos placement BOM. You might need to approve part substitutions, or if you’re stubborn, work to send them a reel of the parts you want used, but mostly Ive found if the part was well stocked on Digikey, Advanced would supply it for me.\nGood Luck!\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/kicad-to-advanced-circuits-for-pcbs-and-assembly/","title":"Kicad to Advanced Circuits for PCBs and Assembly"},"https://citizengadget.com/lasering-pcb-enclosures/":{"body":"\nThis week I used the laser to cut some holes in my enclosures to make way for switches, light pipes, etc. My previous attempts pre-hackerspace (with a dremel) were.. rough.\n\n\nThere had to be a better way! The big problem with using the laser was jigging the case in the laser in such a way that I could reliably and repeatedly cut in the perfect spot. After a few attempts I found a solution.\n\nFirst I exported my front board dimension and mill holes from Eagle using run -&gt; dxf.ulp, opened it in our laser program, mirrored it and adjusted some holes and sizes.\n\nI grabbed a square piece of stock and dropped up the in the upper corner of the laser and homed the laser head. Now, by lasering that outline on my stock, I can take it out of the machine and put it back in the same place every time.\n\nI can also match the PCB up over the top of the etch.\n\nAnd, finally, since the PCB is designed to fit the case perfectly, I can just drop the case on top of the PCB.\n\nWonderful. I could still use a method to cut cleaner on the other 4 sides, but for now Im happy doing a little bit of clean up work and having my cuts be entirely though the case.\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/lasering-pcb-enclosures/","title":"Lasering PCB enclosures"},"https://citizengadget.com/led-light-strip-hacked-for-haptic-motors/":{"body":"\nLast week I got to talk at about my most recent hack, a flexible haptic strip that easy for anyone to use, at Hack N Tell Round 25 in NYC.\nIn between working for ASU's Cubic lab on a new haptic strip, I was pondering ways to bring haptics more to the forefront. Sure you can buy a bare motor or lilypad motor from Sparkfun or elsewhere, but in practice they're a total pain to get working. You need a transistor and its a pain to mount them anywhere you'd want them -- Especially when motors are only really fun when you have a few of them to play with. And lets not even address the cost of say 10 of these modules!\n\nThen it hit me that the cheapest motor driver chip I could buy would be the &lt;14cent WS28XX series LED drivers that get used on LED light strips!\nNow, it's not necessarily THAT novel to use LED drivers to drive motors. Many people, including myself, have done it before, but I realized theres no reason I couldn't use the same flex PCB process as LED strips as a form factor as well.\nI don't yet know how to do flex PCB, and theres is no OSHPark for flex PCB yet :) (paging laen) So I just found an LED strip on ebay that used a common driver chip I liked, that wasn't integrated into the LED which is really common nowadays, and wasnt potted with epoxy or anything.\n\nThe strips don't need many changes for motors. Just pulled the LEDs off and put a motor across one of the 3 channels, top to bottom. You can also add a little LED across one of these channels as well to get visual notification. Finally you'll want to use a multimeter to figure out which resistor hooks up to the motor so you can swap that resistor off for a shunt--You'll want as much current as the driver chip can give you. In the future you may want to add some motor protection with a flyback Schottky diode across where you put the motor to protect the LED driver chip.\nThe additional beauty is theres already a great Arduino library called fastSPI to run these! Just follow the directions for LED light strips. SCK to Pin 13, SDA to Pin 11. They should work on 3v or 5v but I've been running mine at 3v with more wearable Arduinos like the Xadow and Fio V3.\nAnd just like LEDs you can simply cut the strip anywhere you want, from 1 motor to 32, your choice!\nWe've tried them in baseball caps and arms and legs. I think they'd work well sewn into a bag strap. Let me know what form factor you try! And hopefully in the future I'll be able to get them produced for cheaper than hacking them from ebay :)\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/led-light-strip-hacked-for-haptic-motors/","title":"LED Light Strip Hacked for Haptic Motors"},"https://citizengadget.com/lifecam-videos/":{"body":"I've been asked for stiched videos from the camera, so here are links to 3.\nA day at HeatSync fixing the 3D Printer\nMe napping on the (purposely uncomfortable) NapSync Labs couch\nMy Fast and Furious driving\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/lifecam-videos/","title":"LifeCam Videos"},"https://citizengadget.com/lightblue-beanbot/":{"body":"You've Probably seen kilobot swarm videos going around.\nLuis wanted something fun to do with his LightBlue Bean so I set to turn my bean into a remote controlled swarm style bot.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nDESIGN\nFor construction I followed the rabbit hole to find the original research for swarm bots. Theres a lot of math, but the basics appear to be an equilateral triangle, 2 cylindrical motors opposite each other and the lowest possible friction so the vibrations can overcome it.\nI tried a couple designs with common parts and came up with this design:\n\nBean\n3x ~30-50ohm resistor- bigger better because less current and longer battery life, but at some point the motor wont turn on...\nHot glue\nScrap &lt;.5 inch diameter, &gt;.5 inch thick to stick motors to safely (for me it was a laser cut scrap hexagon)\n2x 3v 10mm pancake motors\n\nFor the resistors, basic math said had to be around 20-100 ohm resistor. I tried some out and was seeing about 1v drop across motor. Using an LED calculator presuming our 3v coin cell battery source, and wanting less than 40ma (arduino pin limit) of current you can calculate for our 50-100ohm resistor. I've found some motors are finicky to turn on at such low voltage though so I consider 30-50ohm the appropriate resistor.\nNOTE: Before the engineers write in, yes I know we should have flyback diodes and frankly shouldnt stress the microcontroller pins as close to max current as we might be. We're not selling these things to the government. We'll be fine..\nASSEMBLY\nAlways remove the battery before operating on the bean. Its VERY easy to bridge stuff and you dont want to be done before we've started.\nWe're using the resistors as legs to keep part count down and remove the need for jumpers or other wires. Note this means that the legs are live with voltage. Don't touch them to eacother or let them touch the rest of the board and dont drive on metal surfaces. But frankly with the Bean not in an enclosure you should be mindful of all that normally. Solder one of each to the A0 and D5 holes. Sadly theres no more holes near the center of gravity, so hot glue the third resistor the battery side which we'll call the front.\nMost motors have tape on them otherwise get some double sided tape and put the motors on either side of the spacer and tape it to the top of the ble chip. Again be careful not to touch metal to metal, use extra tape to protect if need be.\nNow solder down the same color wire on each motor to its nearest gnd pad. which ever color you pick will be if your bot drives 'forwards' or 'backwards', whatever that means. For me blue to resistor meant forward was toward battery and third leg resistor. Solder the other wire of each motor the top of the resistor.\nNow you can bend the legs as you like. You're going to have to play with them to get leftish, rightish and straightish motion so dont worry about it too much right now.\nUSE IT\nPreviously I've been working with firmata on bean over ble. This has allowed me to develop js apps that can control my bean from the browser, mac, or mobile with the same codebase.  I think you can control pins from the bean iphone app, but I can't figure it out :)\nUPDATE Luis has a post on using node.js to control beans cross platform including mobile with phonegap.\nFEEDBACK\nLet me know what you find. Does bending the legs a certain way lead to better results. Can you find a better common leg material? Care to program some swarm behavior? I'm @jacobrosenthal on twitter\nSTEERING UPDATE\nI've found it can be tough to change steering by just bending the resistors. Feedback so far has been that changing the resistor can be a more effective way of steering. If one of your motors seems to go, say, right really well, and the other goes only a little left or actually a little right, you can try lowering the resistor for that motor so it gets more power to pull that direction.\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/lightblue-beanbot/","title":"Lightblue BeanBot"},"https://citizengadget.com/limit-switches-and-homing/":{"body":"\nToday I developed custom brackets and installed into our Love-able Fakerbot the Gen4 mechanical endstops.\nWhen we ordered our Gen4 electronics from Makerbot they came with 3 endstops, though the cupcake wasn't terribly suited for them out of the box.

It floated the hash tag #makerbotpredictions to spur discussion of what that might be during the leadup. Some on Twitter have postulated a whole new printer while others the announcement of a new 3d scanner. For my part I don't think Makerbot is going to diversify into something like 3d scanning at the moment. The VC money they received means they will be focusing intently on scaling production and getting more Makerbots in more people's hands. I also don't think they can announce a whole new printer yet. Makerbot has probably a couple thousand existing orders that they can't ship through January or so at least. Those customers could easily cancel orders if some really big news was announced. My prediction is another rev to the existing Makerbot design. I believe they see their main printer line as hardware in beta, constantly being upgraded. The obvious suspects will be an integrated interface kit, dual extruders, and or maybe a change to the underperforming automated build platform.

Our understanding is this is basically the Hero2 in new packaging, though about half as deep and with an advertised battery life claim of something like 8 hours! We put it to the test with our boards one photo a minute, and got 28 hours of battery life!  For reference I was getting ~18 hours on the Hero1 at one photo a minute. The only downfall of the new design is it uses a microsd card, which stops us from using the eyefi which is currently only sold in an SD format. A bunch of googling brought me to the KZ-B19-065, an SD to MicroSD converter which I found for sale on ebay. Sadly, the Gopro either doesn't love the added resistance of the traces, or it just doesnt settle into the slot the same as a typical SD card. Ive had it work for hours at a time and I've also had it crap out after one photo.\nThe new camera allowed Colin to take another crack at the design and put more than an hour into it this time. He also sourced some lanyard material and quick clasps so we have some nice custom lanyards! The result is gorgeous and Ive already gotten several compliments on it.\nFinally Zach did a bunch of work and we now have a gallery site built! As usual were sharing the code on github.

Programming requires the dtr/rts control lines to reset the microcontroller.

I bought everything I could until I found these veryfit id101′s I liked.\n\n\n\nThe id101 have a Nordic nrf51 bluetooth chip which is what I use in my work, and which has two open source bluetooth stacks, Apache Mynewt and Zephyr.\n\nAfter charming my market contact by returning every few days to buy a handful more of them off her, I finally got back to a factory contact on WeChat. They’re made by idoosmart and they agreed to a tour of the factory. I was quite impressed with what I saw. They were clean and had complete testing throughout including water pressure testing every unit as far as I could tell. These guys put out roughly 10k per line per day, and they had several full lines running. I got quotes for something like $9 bucks with no heartrate, and $12 bucks with heartrate in quantities as low as 100. I was paying ~$20 in the markets, and a year later now the id101 can be bought for $20-$40 from any one of many amazon resellers.\nI grabbed one of the cheap USB oscilloscopes in the markets and sat at Gee Coffee Roasters to reverse engineer my board. I desoldered all the components and took a picture to mark up while I probed the board.\n\nIt wasn’t pretty but got the job done. I identified most of the components and connections.\n\nPrinted on board: \"id101 ver 2.1 2016.06.13 3716\"\nNordic nrf51822 qfaca1 1609ab - Bluetooth LE\nhnox ver 2.2 2016.4.19 - HR sensor\nAzoteq iqs263a - Captouch Controller\nna45e - Battery charge or voltage regulator (?)\n\"8c630 og155r\" sot-23-8? - Erm driver (?)\n\"2 w6 358411p ba 6\" (15pin flex ribbon cable to SSD1306 oled\n\"1187-02 hxs 2016.09\" - 4pin Digitizer 4\n\"ib 122\" LGA-12? maybe Bosch Bma250e accelerometer (?)\n\nDurning this time I finally met Ian and Jin from Dangerous Prototypes who told me about their little known Chinese reverse engineering service. For $80 they’ll reverse engineer a populated 2 layer PCB to Protel in a few days. I handed over $80 and a freshly purchased id101. After a few days Jin got back to me and said it was taking a bit longer. I forgot about it and a few weeks later I had a zip file with some nice pics of a 4 layer (oops) board which presumably slowed them down.\n\nThe zip also had the the Protel CAD files. Protel was apparently bought by Altium and is now subsumed into their ~$10k designer tool. I tried to obtain an old copy to run in a VM but it ended up being a huge pain in the ass and so I got bored and put this project down.\nRecently, I found out that Altium’s free (though otherwise uncompetitive) online design tool Circuitmaker will actually import Protel files including PCBS. I opened that old zip file in there and found it looking pretty good!\n\nIt probably took me a day or two of stitching screenshots, probing nets and marking up images in order to get my jpg. My working rate aside, $80 to get a fully interactive view of the board is worth it in every case I can think of.\nSadly, thats about where I left the id101 project. Find the id101 uploaded to my Circuitmaker account with the zipfile as an attachment. Something I’d love to try next would be to try to actually produce a device based on reverse engineered files.\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/paying-china-to-reverse-engineer-for-you/","title":"Paying China to reverse engineer for you"},"https://citizengadget.com/pebble-review/":{"body":"Colin loaned me his Pebble until he gets back into town next month and I haven't seen anyone else in our circle review it, so here goes.\nWho Needs the Time?\nFirst some setup. I don't wear watches and almost never have. Its a modality I think underutilized and one I've still intend to design for, but the truth is I haven't found anything with enough value to wear on my wrist over the 31 years of my life.\nThus I was incredibly surprised to find that after even ONE day of Pebble usage, I felt naked without it.\n\nFit, Finish, Setup\nFirst the boring stuff. I've found the watch to be very pleasant I'm proud to wear it on my wrist daily. It does slightly rotate off my wrist which I find annoying, but perhaps this could be solved with a new or longer watch band.  Further I've found the build quality to be pretty good. Theres a slight rainbow-ing on the screen apparently due to the glue process, but I can live with it.\nIt was extremely easy to set up. I'm sad to report that as usual the locked down iOS ecosystem loses out on the majority of the notifications, only receiving phone calls, texts, and music information and control. Even though it sounds limiting, thats actually enough for me to recommend the pebble with just those few notifications. However, I went the extra mile and used my jailbreak to full push notifications which I highly recommend.\nMusic\nIt turns out Music is one of my favorite features. I listen to podcasts constantly and people typically approach me have to wait for me to dig into iPhone menus in order to pause my audio. With the watch, I found I actually kept my screen on the music control app, rather than the watch, and could, with one button press, pause and play my music. Handy!\nVibration alert\nWhat REALLY surprised me about the watch, however, was how blown away I was by the vibrator in the watch. Most people know that I've been doing research and development in haptics for several years now. I obviously understand the benefits of haptics and am somewhat biased, but I was curious to see what I'd think of the real world implementation.\nI immediately found it incredibly freeing. As we all know phantom vibrations have completely poisoned the haptics well when it comes to our phones. We can't leave them on vibrate because in the back of our mind we know that is as good as turning them off.\nWith vibration on my wrist I found I didn't worry about missing anything on my phone and I was happy to silence it permanently. I also loved using vibration as my alarm. I hate alarms and they don't tend to even wake me up so adding vibration to my wrist really was a fun and new way to wake up. It should be noted that Pebble actually deals with alarms in its own OS, not in iOS, but besides this setback I found alarms easy enough to set and delete.\nI did, however, find one big problem with using the watch as an alarm.\nBattery Life\n~~I'm sorry to report I'm getting only two days under typical use. Im not sure if thats backlight, vibration or bluetooth communication issues, but I'm ready to sacrifice something, ANYTHING, in order to get more battery life. They may be able to patch some of this in, but its definitely the weak point of the system.~~ (ed. note: battery got SIGNIFICANTLY better just weeks later. Not a problem anymore!)\nThis is worsened by the need for a proprietary magnetic charger cable. I have to keep yet one more cable, or more likely I don't have the cable I need and theres a useless monolith tied to my wrist all day.\nWrap up\nIn conclusion if I have anything negative to say about the Pebble is I feel they may have done too much, which is not surprising the way it was scope creep developed in public. ~~Battery life seems to be suffering~~ , charging suffers presumably due to the need to get water proofing at X feet deep, etc etc. ~~Maybe eventually we'll be able to disable some of the software based features in order to save battery life, but right now we're stuck.~~\nThat is we're stuck with a device which can't call anything other than incredible. I can't image what I'm going to do when I have to give it back to Colin.\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/pebble-review/","title":"Pebble review"},"https://citizengadget.com/print-defects-flashing/":{"body":"\nThis is the first in a series on a series of guest posts from Prescott Ogden (@prescottogden) discussing print defects, why they occur and what to do about them.\nIn the course of raftlessly printing dozens of mrule's Polyhedron Vertices, I've encountered a print defect I've termed \"flashing\" after a similar defect in injection molded parts. This is a slight flaring at the base of a part, where it meets the print bed, as well as a finite reduction in the finished part, e.g. 12mm parts are 11.5mm, 50mm parts are 49.5mm.\nThis is normally not a big deal, but the polyhedron vertices snap together near the base, so the flashing interferes with mating between parts. It can also cause problem if you need parts with a very specific height.\nAs far as I can tell, this is because our Z axis offset is set too low. For good print cohesion, we make sure smear down the first few layers of plastic as hard as possible. This causes flexing in the axis, and that layer is shorter and therefore wider. On the next layer, the same thing happens, but there is less flexing, so flare is slightly less, until the flexing is constant. This gives rise to both the height reduction and the trianglar flaring at the base of the part.\nThe simplest solution is to adjust the starting point up by the amount of the height reduction, however, we then lose the bed adhesion benefits of smearing the first layer, and raftless printing becomes impossible. In order to get correct, or at least workable geometry while maintaining the print bed adhesion, I've developed the following OpenSCAD script where example.stl is the stl you're altering:\nfile = \"example.stl\";\nheight_reduction = .8;\nchamfer_radius = 0.6;\nchamfer_height = 2.1;\nepsilon = 0.001;\nenvelope_size = 1000;\n\n//Chamfer\n\ndifference() {\n    //Height Boost\n    union(){\n        translate([0, 0, height_reduction])\n        import(file);\n        linear_extrude( height =height_reduction, center = false) projection(cut = true) import(file);\n    }\n\n    minkowski() {\n        difference() {\n            translate([0, 0, epsilon/2])\n            cube(size=[envelope_size, envelope_size, epsilon], center = true);\n            linear_extrude( height = 2*epsilon, center = true) projection(cut = true) import(file);\n        }\n        cylinder(r1=chamfer_radius, h =chamfer_height, r2 = 0, center = false, $fn=10);\n    }\n}\n\nThis code simply pads the bottom of the part, so the overall height will be correct, then chamfers it using a minkowski sum, so that when flashing occurs, it brings the part out to the desired perimeter, rather than beyond it.\nThis hack is not ideal, it still distorts any features close to the bottom of the part. A better solution might be to modify or configure skeinforge to adjust the z-height and width over thickness on a per-layer basis, or more simply to put and extra height_reduction between the first and second layers. Despite it's shortcomings, the chamfer approach solved my mating problems with the polyhedron vertices, and it's a good first step.\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/print-defects-flashing/","title":"Print defects: Flashing"},"https://citizengadget.com/re-engineering-vending-electronics/":{"body":"I've always been fascinating by vending machines.\nTheres something romantic about the defunct automats.

I look to ubiqoutious technological countries like Korea or Japan with interest as their societies find hilarious and awesome uses for vending.\nAnd as the maker movement looks to understand the world around them, I see us dissecting all the 'black boxes' of our society.

Further of note, the Thingomatic(TOM) is now End of Life(EOL) though Makerbot is committed to supporting existing owners.\nThe major announcements on the Replicator design were dual MK7 nozzles, integrated interface kit, and a removal of the build platform. Sound familiar?\nThe big difference nobody saw coming seems to be a move towards the z axis being on the platform now and the nozzle being on the x/y, much like the Ultimaker. In the short term this will mean a slight speed increase as the platform won't wobble the print all around during prints. In the long run though, theres such legacy weight in the design that I don't see capability for massive speed increase without further improvements.\nWe made some fun of the new design as simple a TOM turned upside down and got some laughs on the forums, but in all honesty these are all great improvements. There are shiny new linear bearings ,injection molded parts, laser cut parts, and custom machined parts--all indicating a more mature product and, in addition to the extras, is a big reason why they've had to increase the price to $1749 with one extruder, $1999 with dual extrusion.\nI got a chance to see one while in China at the Maker Carnival Beijing Seeed Studios booth and it was printing smooth as you'd expect. The print quality wasn't particularly superior to a TOM with MK7 nozzle, which isn't really surprising. I think we won't know how much better the machine is until we assemble, or rather disassemble one as they come assembled now.

Even for experienced laser users, good plastic can be hard to come by. Plain clear acrylic can be found at home depot, though possibly not the best quality for laser cutting (extruded is more resilient than cast) or in a thickness or size you might want. Online shops offer many different colors, but shipping is costly and takes time! Local shops will sometimes sell small quantity of what they call 'remnants' but more often than not you have to buy plastic in a 4'x8' sheet costing between $75 and $180 each!\nOther spaces we've been to have had large markups on plastic, ugly colors, a messy scrap bin, or worse, nothing to cut at all!\nMy goal was to have a really nice selection of nice (often transparent rather than the boring opaque) colors available for our laser cutter.\nI researched for weeks, calling around finding the best prices, and also looking for deals on who had a sheet of some exotic color lying around which they could ship with some other order. I ended up spending $1074 on plastic from Port Plastics in Chandler, AZ who shipped several other orders to me from their suppliers mainly in California. Frankly it was more than I wanted to spend, but was the only way I could get the selection of colors and sizes at the prices I needed. I bought fluorescent yellow, fluorescent blue, red, blue, clear, and HeatSync transparent orange and black in 1/4\" and 1/8\".\nI also paid $152.54 for a locker that was sized perfectly for the plastic as well as some flashlights and other electronics for prototyping a lit display and self checkout square app for an old iphone I had lying around (which I never did finish.)\nBesides labor of researching, transporting, and up keeping the station, I had no other costs. I did no marketing, paid or otherwise.\nPRICING\nBunnie talked about hardware markups and needing to hit sweet spots like $99 or $149 in a recent interview he did with Make:\nA general rule of thumb when selling to wholesale is to double your price, so you keep that, and that your retailer will double again to sell to public. So if it cost you $10, sell it for $20, and they're going to sell it for $40.\nHowever back then when I set out I'd never sold anything before in quantity, read that blog, or traveled to China to learn about manufacturing.\nMy markups were derived from other local and online vendors, what I thought people would pay, and guessing. My goals were 160%, 185%, 235% for 2'x4', 2'x2', and 1'x1' sheets respectively. The hope was to incentivize larger purchases of acrylic to move stock quicker.\nFor brevity I'll just post my spreadsheet for clear, 1/8\" acrylic:\n\nAs Bunnie talked about in his interview, I instinctively found that I had to hit quantization numbers. Plastic needed to cost $5 dollars, or $10 dollars, not odd numbers in between like $7.25 or $3.50. What this meant in the end was needing to settle for lower margins on certain sizes, or needing to push the costs up. As you can see, the reality was close to my goals, but not exact. On 1'x1' I wanted 235% markup, but only hit 213%. On 2'x2' I wanted 185% but I only got 160%. However, on 2'x4' I hit my mark perfectly at 160%. The other colors and sizes were very similar to these numbers, slightly above or below my goals.\nOf course I wasn't looking for a monopoly on plastic at the lab--despite the fact that I named my business The Acrylic Magnate. Everyone was still encouraged to bring in their own plastic, and I specifically already had been tracking down cheap cut offs from plastic suppliers so we had, and have continued to have an awesome stock of free plastic, wood and cardboard for laser cutting.\nI also wanted to be as 'open source' as I could be so I listed all my research on suppliers and prices on our wiki.\nFor the past year the station has been running successfully. I have a clear cash box out with three five dollar bills in it for people to make change, a price list, and my local tax documentation (oops, forgot to add that into my costs). For this wrap up I am going to assume I haven't been stolen from either in plastic or in money and that people haven't messed up prices in my favor or otherwise--which I believe to be true in both cases.\nTHE SALES NUMBERS\nBecause the station is setup and you can just pay there (and because I couldn't get a good square or other point of sale system set up) I don't necessarily know what I've sold, or for how much. I know business majors out there, I can hear you screaming at me. Where I could though, I've actually been able to track down most of my sales as we're a small enough shop.\nSo after a year I've made\nDrumroll please\nthirty individual sales and grossed $430, or 1/3 of my initial investment. Apologies to all the business students' families whose loved ones just killed themselves on my behalf.\n\n1/3 of sales has been clear, with more than half colors (the rest is wood and unidentified sales)\n1/5 was 1/4\", half x 1/8\nMore than 1/2 was 1'x1's, with just 1/5 2'x2', and only two 2'x4' despite their value!\n\nANALYSIS\nSo thirty sales is obviously just... very low. As big as our space has gotten, we really don't have much walk through traffic, certainly not what we saw when we were located within Gangplank who had church groups and football meetings traipsing through everyday. Secondly only some small percentage of that walkthrough traffic is going to find a sponsor to use the machine, or go through the whole class and need plastic. So sales of acrylic currently seems to be a poor proposition in general.\nSo what could be done differently? Well, first a question, how many people used my material vs bringing their own? I can't know this, but anyone from HeatSync reading this knows I keep tabs on nearly everything in the lab so I'm actually quite sure. Despite that fact that HeatSync is an awesome community of smart people very few of them went out and bought material of their own and I would argue a large majority used my stock! Via this, and anecdotally the few people that bitched to me about my prices, I believe we can know that my prices were reasonable.\nFinally, as we many of you out there noticed I said a typical retail markup is 200-300 percent and you may have noticed my markups were only 120-230 at best. As we know, my prices were largely considered reasonable which means I could clearly attempt to raise prices to meet demand (or lack there of).\nWRAP UP\nSo as an experiment in sales, this wasn't a very successful endeavor. I misjudged our growth, our foot traffic, and the amount of plastic needed by people when they share their scrap. All is not lost obviously, there were many reasons for me to set up the station other than making money. HeatSync has had, as far as I'm concerned, a really cool acrylic station with all sorts exotic colors for sale 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Many here have made really cool things with my plastic, and have thanked me for keeping it available. And of course I still have my stock of plastic. If I sell all of my remaining 1/8\" stock and none of my 1/4\" stock (or some combination thereof) I'll have made my initial investment back, and that seems likely over the next year or so as we continue to grow. Finally, as I mentioned, I also retain the option of raising prices.\nSo what about this capitalistic passion driving responsibility stuff I mentioned? Historically we've had trouble at HeatSync with money based endeavors. People largely dislike charging for things, even when necessary, and hate having to value themselves or others. I also believe they dislike making money for others. Case in point we've sold Arduinos and other electronics gear as fundraising for the past two years already! Did you even know that? Even though its been two year, I can't give you any interesting numbers on it, no one at the lab advertises it, and the board is always busy doing 100 other things than manage or grow it. It turns out no one came here because they wanted to work for Radio Shack for free-- they came here to hack.\nSo did I take care of my little station more than I would have if HeatSync owned it and I just had (yet another) task? I would say resoundingly yes. I have the numbers for my own business, and I wrote this blog post here, didn't I  :) I always kept the station clean, cash available for change, and plastic cut to every size. But I have to admit I didn't do all I could. I knew very early on I wasn't making, well any, money from my endeavors. Had they been profitable I think I would have spent more time on it. I wish I would have gotten the lit display and POS systems set up, at least as an example for others to try similar experiments. But in the end, I know I did more, and kept it going longer, than I would of if I was making money for someone else.\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/the-acrylic-magnate-turns-one-year-old/","title":"The Acrylic Magnate Turns One Year Old"},"https://citizengadget.com/the-mdb-specification-for-lay-people/":{"body":"I'm mainly working off of the specifications document by the NAMA people located at http://www.vending.org/technology/MDB_Version_4-1.pdf\nPinout:\nGRN 6 MCommon 3 NC\nRED 5 MTX 2 0DC BRN\nBLK 4 MRX 1 34DC WHT\nSerial Communications:\n9600\n1 start bit, 8 bits data, 1 mode bit, 1 check bit, 1 stop bit\ncheck bit\n\ndrop carry byte, address+all data bytes.\nA checksum will not be performed on ACK, NAK, or RET bytes.\n\nmode bit-\n\nfrom vmc sets if byte is address\nfrom slave if last byte of data (or finished talking to master?)\n\ntransmit nrz\nreceive inverted\nMisc:\n\"Each peripheral should be polled every 25-200 milliseconds.

It was a pretty easy build for him, except for the usual firmware programming issues (for the motherboard I just had a better timing touch, for the extruder we re-burned the bootloader and still couldn't upload until we finally we disconnected the molex and not-ethernet and it took... shrug)\nThe real annoyance was the mk7 build. Its their most recent creation, and the build instructions belay that. Theres 4 different positions you can assemble the bar mount and its incredibly difficult to understand which they actually want you to use. I built it one way and had to redo it later to make it fit the mounting bracket. Then @virgilvox reported having to rebuild it again after I left. Then the filament wouldn't go through and we had to rebuild it again. Finally @VirgilVox wanted to argue about which side the filament pusher was supposed to be on so he rebuilt it. Not a great experience.\nAfter that we just had to tighten down the x and y belts and it was printing gorgeous 'out of the box'. I have to say it was a definitively advanced experience compared to the Cupcake days.\nThe real star of the show is certainly the new Mk7,though. Check out the resolution and z transition seam of the Mk7 and 1.75mm filament on the left and our custom Mk5 with 3mm filament on the right.\n\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/thingomatic-build-heatsynclabs/","title":"Thingomatic Build @heatsynclabs"},"https://citizengadget.com/top-10-makerbotrep-rap-upgrades-and-tips/":{"body":"\nWe’ve been printing for 2 years now at HeatSync and I thought I’d put together some of my top tips for new printer owners. Some of them are hard won, others are from other bloggers in the Rep Rap/Makerbot community over the years so as such I’ll take no credit for any of these innovations.\n\n\nIf you’re not on a stepper driven extruder like the MK6 or MK7, it is time to upgrade. All of the innovation in 3D printing is happening in stepper extruders. With the control they provide we can finally alter extrusion speed which fixes all SORTS of problems from first layer curling to ooze and ‘towers.’ The MK7 has amazing resolution but doubles the print time of the MK6 so decide if you need fine quality or speed.\nForget about the conveyer belt on your fancy new Thing-o-matic. It a great idea, and will mature eventually, but current design is a big problem for prints of any decent size. First, it is just a 'squishy’ surface to print on. You want a really firm surface to push plastic onto to get your first layer started so your print sticks all the way through your marathon prints. Secondly, the tension curls the belt along the y axis which will further ruin prints. Like the optimized Thing-o-matic build instructions recommend, Buy Makerbot’s aluminum build surface.\nFurther, don’t just print on your aluminum platform with Kapton on top of it as suggested. You dont wan’t to be prying prints off that platform, putting stress on your Y stage! Nor do you want to wait 10 minutes for your platform to cool off to get your part off so you can wait 5 minutes for the build surface to get back up to temperature! Use Kapton covered glass on top of your aluminum surface, held down by document clips! Now you can quickly swap out your finished part with another piece of glass and let it cool until you can crack your print off AND your machine will stay at temperature between prints! (Glass can be had at Ace hardware cut to whatever size you want for like .40 each!)\nNow, how do you get that damn sticky expensive Kapton tape onto the build platform without bubbles? Cut your piece of Kapton out and put soapy water on the sticky side! Now you’ll be able to reposition the film over and over again until it dries. Use a credit card to squeegee out the film evenly and you’ll have an amazing build surface with no bubbles.\nPrint platform leveling thumbscrews. You need to be able to level your print surface quickly and occasionally on the fly. I’ve saved many prints by watching the first layer and adjusting my bed with the thumb screws. In order to get the nuts into the plastic, heat them up with a lighter or torch or something and they’ll slide and stick into their place perfectly.\nOK, one more build platform tip :) If you’re STILL getting first layer curling, scrub your platform down with acetone. However, BE CAREFUL! Acetone really opens the pores on the Kapton and I’ve had prints stick so well I had to break the glass to get them off!\nPrint spool holders. Filament is notorious for getting all tangled up 2 hours into your 3 hour print. You can’t print long term without a good system for your filament to unwind. You may also need to look into filament guides to keep the filament unwinding smoothly.\nLeave a usb cable INSIDE your Thing-o-matic attached to the extruder controller. The LAST thing you want to do is to open up your whole machine every time a firmware upgrade is released.\nBuy more plastic in more colors! I love Makerbot, so feel free to support them by buying their filament. However they’re often they’re out of what I want or don’t have the colors I need. We’ve been using 3D Printer Stufffor filament purchases for the past few months and have been quite happy so far we have been having trouble lately with no response from them yet! We’re looking for a new vendor now.\nGet into the community! All these tips came from watching the 3D printing blogs and forums. No matter which 3D printer you have, make sure to check the Thingiverse, Makerbot and Rep Rap blogs often. Also follow the Makerbot Google Groups and the Rep Rap Forums for great advice from DIY 3D printing pros.\n\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/top-10-makerbotrep-rap-upgrades-and-tips/","title":"Top 10 Makerbot/Rep Rap Upgrades and Tips"},"https://citizengadget.com/toxicity-inclusivity-and-community-size/":{"body":"I've been struggling with the topic of toxic communication and poisonous people in our community spaces for years now. Only recently though have I been able to start collecting my thoughts and looking for answers. Today I saw that Openfly wrote an interesting article on hackerspaces.org titled \"Redefining Hackerspaces\" which jived well with my scribblings. I don't want to put words in his mouth so instead I'll quote some of the conclusion:\n\"We need to accept that trust networks don’t scale beyond a certain point. That trust is built on some commonality. That a community cannot be all things to all people.\"\n\nI'm beginning to come to the same conclusion, that community spaces that don't have the resources or the goal of becoming a place that pays (trained) staff CAN NOT be (radically) inclusive...\nIn an ideal world we should be able to communicate our grievances, work beyond our differences, simply avoid (and NOT sabotage) those who we don't mesh with -- all while still getting shit done. Sadly, our society (and thus our community spaces) don't seem to work that way.\nWe're seeing more and more toxic communication in our communities online and off. Tons of talk of twitter, reddit, hacker news, and other communities being toxic. We've got new newspapers and blogs removing their comments sections (finally). We've got every major tech conference the past few years with a big sexual harassment 'scandal'. And in my world, huge problems in our community spaces with angry people seemingly measuring how toxic they can be against how much value they bring in.\nMany people will say its just our demographic. Males, Nerds, Engineers. 18-24's. But it sure seems to transcend into politics, religion, and all other quarters of our society. In the end it doesn't matter, because we are in tech and thats our demographic whether we like it or not.\nAsk anybody who served on the board of our nonprofit hackerspace HeatSync Labs over the past 2 years, and they'll tell you they spent approaching 0% of their time envisioning and executing on what kind of awesome nonprofit we should be and instead spent all of their time babysitting and psychoanalyzing a CONSTANT (albeit minority) population of angry members.\nWhy are they so angry at this person, their project, or the way they they were spoken to? Have they tried talking to them? Have they tried not yelling at them? Have they offered to help? Were they broken up with recently? Are they having problems at work?\nAnd thats all just to stay afloat, let alone make a dent in the problem.\nAs a result we've got the policy and administrative types screaming at us to make more rules in order to deal with all the jerks.\nHowever, I hope we can think critically and see that rules don't make unhealthy people healthy.\nI'm not sure theres any way to make unhealthy people healthy than doing the hard work of sitting them down, forcing them to view their actions, and ESPECIALLY if their actions are getting them the results they want. And if we find that what they really want is to pain others, then we have the unpleasant (and increasingly impossible) job of removing them from our communities--rules or no rules.\nSadly all this takes energy, time, and pain which LITERALLY the opposite of why we come to communities. In fact, thats the kind of deep conflict resolution that frankly takes training and experience.\nThats why I'm starting to agree with Openfly's conclusion that communities should not (frankly CAN NOT) be (radically) inclusive, at least not without paying staff as community managers, mediators, and at the end of the day authorities to make decisions and remove people from the community.\nI'm not saying HeatSync (or your community here) have to pay community managers, but I am saying the only other option I see is to start getting less inclusive. Smaller like-minded communities (somewhere &lt; the tribe number) who share life experiences, ways of talking to eachother, and to some extent political views will still find strife and toxic people, but are seemingly WAY more capable of communicating with eachother while still actually getting shit done-- which is what we all came here for in the first place.\n","id":"https://citizengadget.com/toxicity-inclusivity-and-community-size/","title":"Toxicity, Inclusivity, and Community Size"},"https://citizengadget.com/turning-gopro-into-a-lifelogging-camera/":{"body":"\nRecently my hetero life partner Colin Ho and I turned a GoPro Hero into a lifelogger camera.  I've wanted to do life logging forever but never got my stuff together so when Colin brought in the camera in and made the challenge, I was in.\n\nTake a look at Colin's post, but basically,  we pulled some code, schematics and a pinout from this guy and set to implementing it all in one night at our hackerspace HeatSync Labs. I laid out the board in Eagle and etched it Colin did up all the mechanical designs (laser and 3d printed). The only speciality part we needed was an iPhone connector which, since this is a hackerspace, we had stashed around ;) The result is hosted on Our Git.\nColin has been using the camera for ~3 weeks while traveling and Ive been using it for about a week. In my tests at approximately 2 pictures per minute I'm getting 18h hour battery life on a used old GoPro Hero.\nThe daylight results are awesome. The camera placement with the fish eye lens is perfect. Im picking up conversation partners, meals, a great view of my laptop, phone, and any projects I'm hacking on.\n\nThe only problem is blurriness in ~50% of shots. Basically without knowing if the shot is being taken we're not staying still. We may want to turn on the GoPro's audible beep again, or do something light or haptic based to notify of the impending shot, but theres an argument for not changing my life or becoming aware of when shots are being taken.\n\nThe real drawback so far has been the low light response which is TERRIBLE. Blurriness probably goes up over 75% especially if theres ANY motion. For a worst case scenario I took it out to a nightclub (where I drank and danced way too much for photos anyway) and only got maybe ten usable photos out of a thousand!\n\nThis was an average GOOD shot! Still, I got ten awesome photos I wouldn't have had otherwise.\nTo get around this I'm going to up my shot rate and expect to throw away half of my photos.

It is half thickness from the Hero 2 and can do eight hours on intervalometer so we may just be able to use that camera out of the box without external modification.

The Fakerbot has still been far too finicky and far too difficult for most of our users to use on a regular basis.\nI've personally moved away from the idea of the Rep Rap for now. I'ts a beautiful goal, but I'd rather spend the next 5 years actually 3d printing rather than figuring out how to replace all the precision parts and processes with cheap and ubiquitous not-terrible ones. Precision in precision out...\nA sexy underdog right now is the Ultimaker which has x and y movement on the print head and the z on the platform which, combined with some good firmware, are allowing them to do much larger and faster prints. It's got some of the community of Rep Rap and Makerbot, but still the precision of laser cut and machined parts.\nOr we could move towards some of the more commercial machines like the impressive, but delicate, Z-corp that made our Theo Jansen Walker.  Those retail around 20k and the binder and powder are costly as well. You can't deny the output though...\nFinally there's the obvious answer, just stick with the Makerbot guys.  My philosophy has always been to stay where the public's attention is, even if there are shortcomings. They won't be behind for long given the amount of engineers they have working on the problem, both within and without.
