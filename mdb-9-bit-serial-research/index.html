  		<p>I've done some reasearch on arduino, atmel and 9 bit serial. Again my goal is to stay as much in the Open Source toolchain as possible so that I don't have to support any more than I have to, and so my result is as standardized as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>The arduino serial can not handle 9 bit transactions. :(</li>
<li>Atmel, however does support it. &quot;1 start bit • 5,6,7,8,or9databits • no, even or odd parity bit • 1or2stopbits&quot;</li>
<li>Looking at the existing Atmel serial library it is sadly hardcoded to 8 bits.</li>
<li>Theres a bitbang serial library for arduino called New Soft Serial. It does not do 9 bit either :(. It seems like it would be not too terribly difficult to alter that code though.</li>
</ul>
<p>So my options are</p>
<ul>
<li>a fresh atmel library, which arduino people wouldn't look at.</li>
<li>A fresh arduino hardware or software serial implementation which I may be able to get upstreamed to them,</li>
<li>altering the existing NSS product and attempting to get that upstreamed.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now I choose altering NSS as it will be the least path of resistance. Here goes nothing.</p>
