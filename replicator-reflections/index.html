  		<p>By now you should have noticed that Makerbot has <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2012/01/09/introducing-the-makerbot-replicator/">announced</a> their new 3D printer, th Replicator, and over the past few months has started shipping them. Further of note, the Thingomatic(TOM) is now End of Life(EOL) though Makerbot is <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2012/04/17/makerbot-thing-o-matics-where-we-are-now/">committed</a> to supporting existing owners.</p>
<p>The major announcements on the Replicator design were dual MK7 nozzles, integrated interface kit, and a removal of the build platform. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The big difference nobody saw coming seems to be a move towards the z axis being on the platform now and the nozzle being on the x/y, much like the Ultimaker. In the short term this will mean a slight speed increase as the platform won't wobble the print all around during prints. In the long run though, theres such legacy weight in the design that I don't see capability for massive speed increase without further improvements.</p>
<p>We made some fun of the new design as simple a TOM turned upside down and got some <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/makerbot/wG7uSO2Jcmc">laughs on the forums</a>, but in all honesty these are all great improvements. There are shiny new linear bearings ,injection molded parts, laser cut parts, and custom machined parts--all indicating a more mature product and, in addition to the extras, is a big reason why they've had to increase the price to $1749 with one extruder, $1999 with dual extrusion.</p>
<p>I got a chance to see one while in China at the <a href="http://www.makercarnival.com/">Maker Carnival Beijing</a> Seeed Studios booth and it was printing smooth as you'd expect. The print quality wasn't particularly superior to a TOM with MK7 nozzle, which isn't really surprising. I think we won't know how much better the machine is until we assemble, or rather disassemble one as they come assembled now. I think my hope, and Makerbot's, is that these machines will need less maintenance, and when they do it won't mean massive disassembly.</p>
