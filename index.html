Last week I got to talk at about my most recent hack, a flexible haptic strip that easy for anyone to use, at Hack N Tell Round 25 in NYC.
In between working for ASU's Cubic lab on a new haptic strip, I was pondering ways to bring haptics more to the for…

This week I used the laser to cut some holes in my enclosures to make way for switches, light pipes, etc. My previous attempts pre-hackerspace (with a dremel) were.. rough.


There had to be a better way! The big problem with using the laser was jigging …
